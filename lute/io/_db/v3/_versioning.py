"""Schema versioning and migrations for the v3 database specification.

The schema version of a database file is stored in `PRAGMA user_version`. v3
files start at `V3_BASE_USER_VERSION` (300) and every later schema change within
v3 is a migration which increments it. v1/v2 files never set it, so they read 0.
