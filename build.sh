$(basename "$0"):
    Build an installation of LUTE.

    This build script will create an isolated build environment. It is cached in
    your home directory under ~/.cache/lute_build_env_XXXX_PYVER where the final portion
    is created from a hash of base installation directory.

    Subsequent runs of the build will not need to re-create the build environment,
    speeding up the process significantly. You can of course delete the build environment
    from the specified folder at any time, and it will be recreated next time the script
    is run. You can pass a parameter to this script to do cleanup as well.

    Options:
        -c|--clean
          Clean up the build environment
        -h|--help
          Display this message.

    Options that apply on subsequent runs of the build script:
        -e|--entry_points
          Re-run the pip install command. This is only needed if pyproject.toml is
          modified.
        -r|--reconfigure
          Re-run the meson setup. This is only required if meson.build files have been
          modified, or meson options/the install prefix have changed since the last
          time it was run.
        -s|--source_pyenv
          Use an additional source environment. Can be used to build multiple versions
          of the extensions. E.g. to have 3.9 and 3.11 Python extension libraries.
